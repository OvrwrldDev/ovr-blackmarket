# ovr-blackmarket
This repo comes with a custom made Armsdealer and Ammodealer asset. Built for qb-core use ONLY!


This system is built for ps-inventory. However this can be changed by editing **exports['ps-inventory']** to your desired inventory system. Out of the box, it is configured for SMG's, Assault Rifles, and Shotguns.

The location of the dealers can be changed in the cofig.lua file for it's respective asset.

The Ammo dealer is made with the Arms dealer asset, so all code is practically identical just minus one is for ammo the other for weapons
